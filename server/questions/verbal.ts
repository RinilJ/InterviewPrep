      question: `Read the following passage:
The process ofphotosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth. Plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. The sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll in the leaves, which converts light energy into chemical energy. This energy is used to split water molecules and combine them with carbon dioxide to form glucose. Oxygen is released as a byproduct of this process. The glucose can either be used immediately by the plant for energy or stored as starch for later use.

What is the primary function of chlorophyll in photosynthesis?`,
