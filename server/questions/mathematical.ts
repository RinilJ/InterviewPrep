      question: "A bag contains 3 red and 2 blue balls. What is the probability of drawing a red ball?",
      options: ["3/5", "2/5", "1/2", "2/3"],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Probability = Number of favorable outcomes/Total outcomes = 3/5"

      question: "Two dice are rolled. What is the probability of getting a sum of 7?",
      options: ["1/6", "1/8", "1/12", "1/36"],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "There are 6 ways to get sum 7 out of 36 possible combinations, so probability = 6/36 = 1/6"
